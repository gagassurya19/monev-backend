# Table Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup of database tables that were not being used by the application endpoints. The cleanup was performed to reduce database complexity and improve maintainability.

## Tables Removed

### From `create_monev_tables.sql`:

1. **`etl_status`** - Not used by any endpoints
   - Was intended for additional ETL tracking
   - Functionality covered by `log_scheduler` table

2. **`system_logs`** - Not used by any endpoints
   - Was intended for application logging
   - Application uses file-based logging instead

3. **`api_requests`** - Not used by any endpoints
   - Was intended for monitoring API usage
   - No implementation found in the codebase

## Tables Kept (Actually Used)

### Core Application Tables:
1. **`users`** - Used by `authService.js` for authentication
2. **`raw_log`** - Used by `etlService.js` for ETL process
3. **`course_activity_summary`** - Used by `course-performance.js`
4. **`student_profile`** - Used by `course-performance.js`
5. **`student_quiz_detail`** - Used by `course-performance.js`
6. **`student_assignment_detail`** - Used by `course-performance.js`
7. **`student_resource_access`** - Used by `course-performance.js`
8. **`course_summary`** - Used by `course-performance.js`
9. **`log_scheduler`** - Used by `etlService.js` and `course-performance.js`

### ETL Chart Tables:
10. **`etl_chart_categories`** - Used by `student-activity-summary.js`
11. **`etl_chart_subjects`** - Used by `student-activity-summary.js`
12. **`etl_chart_logs`** - Used by `student-activity-summary.js`

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Impacts:
- Reduced database complexity
- Faster database setup and migration
- Cleaner schema with only necessary tables
- Reduced maintenance overhead
- Better performance due to fewer unused indexes

### No Negative Impacts:
- All existing functionality remains intact
- All endpoints continue to work as expected
- No breaking changes to the application

## Verification

The cleanup was verified by:
1. Analyzing all database queries in the codebase
2. Checking all service files for table usage
3. Ensuring no endpoints reference the removed tables
4. Confirming all existing functionality is preserved

## Files Modified

1. **`scripts/create_monev_tables.sql`** - Removed 3 unused tables and merged with `create_etl_tables.sql`
2. **`scripts/create_etl_tables.sql`** - **DELETED** (merged into `create_monev_tables.sql`)

## Database Consolidation

### Before:
- `scripts/create_monev_tables.sql` - Tables for `monev_db` database
- `scripts/create_etl_tables.sql` - Tables for `moodle_logs` database

### After:
- `scripts/create_monev_tables.sql` - **Complete script for both databases**
  - Part 1: `monev_db` tables (12 tables)
  - Part 2: `moodle_logs` tables (7 tables)
  - Total: 19 tables across 2 databases

## Migration Notes

If you have existing databases with the removed tables, you can safely drop them:

```sql
-- Drop unused tables (if they exist)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS etl_status;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS system_logs;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS api_requests;
```

These tables were not referenced by any application code, so dropping them will not affect functionality.

## Usage

To create all tables for both databases, simply run:

```bash
mysql -u root -p < scripts/create_monev_tables.sql
```

This single script will create all necessary tables for both `monev_db` and `moodle_logs` databases.
